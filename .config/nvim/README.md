# Global Install

To install globally:

```
git clone https://github.com/jameswalmsley/nvcode.git -b global-install nvcode.global
cd nvcode.global/utils/bin
sudo ./nvcode-upgrade.sh -g
```

This install a copy of the nvcode config into `/usr/local/share/nvcode/nvim`, and installs the nv,
starter script to `/usr/local/bin`

The script will use sudo to run nvim as the calling user to sync plugins to `~/.local/share/nvcode/data/nvim`.

It leaves nvim open, simply exit nvim when finished. (Couldn't get headless nvim to not quit early on packer).

Once completed you should be able to run nv without interfering with the main .config/nvim config.

NOTE.. This global install will use `.config/nvcode/nvim`

# Overview

This project aims to help one transition away from VSCode, and into a superior text editing experience. (Just making this clear)

This is also a community project, if you would like to see support for a feature or language consider making a PR.

## Install In One Command!

Make sure you have the newest version of Neovim

``` bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChristianChiarulli/nvim/master/utils/installer/install.sh)
```

After installation run `nvim` and then `:PackerInstall`

## Get the latest version of Neovim

```bash
cd ~
sudo rm -r neovim
git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim
cd neovim
sudo make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release install
cd ~
sudo rm -r neovim
```
or if you are on Arch you can get it from the AUR
```bash
yay -S neovim-nightly-git
```

## VSCode support

I recommend you support Free/Libre versions if you plan to use VSCode:

- [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)

- Article to get you set up with VSCodium: [link](https://www.chrisatmachine.com/Neovim/22-vscodium-neovim/) 

After installing the [Neovim
extension](https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim) in VSCode

I recommend using this alongside the VSCode
[which-key](https://github.com/VSpaceCode/vscode-which-key) extension

You will also need `settings.json` and `keybindings.json` which can be
found in utils/vscode\_config

Point the nvim path to your `nvim` binary

Point your `init.vim` path to:

``` vim
$HOME/.config/nvim/vimscript/nv-vscode/init.vim
```

## Clipboard Support

- On Mac `pbcopy` should be built-in

- Ubuntu

    ```bash
    sudo apt install xsel
    ```

- Arch

    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S xsel
    ```

- WSL2

    Make sure ~/bin is in your path in this case.
    
    ```bash
    curl -sLo/tmp/win32yank.zip https://github.com/equalsraf/win32yank/releases/download/v0.0.4/win32yank-x64.zip
    unzip -p /tmp/win32yank.zip win32yank.exe > /tmp/win32yank.exe
    chmod +x /tmp/win32yank.exe
    mv /tmp/win32yank.exe ~/bin
    ```

## LSP

To install a supported language server:

``` bash
  :LspInstall <your_language_server>
```

Most common languages should be supported out of the box, if yours is not I would welcome a PR

For a more in depth LSP support:
[link](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/CONFIG.md)

## Useful Programs

``` bash
ranger
ueberzug
fd
ripgrep
jq
fzf
lazygit
lazydocker
ncdu
pynvim
neovim-remote
```

## EFM server

In order for linters and formatters to work you will need to install
`efm-langserver`

```vim
:LspInstall efm
```

## Formatters and Linters

**Python**

``` bash
pip3 install --user flake8
pip3 install --user yapf
```

**Lua**

``` bash
luarocks install --server=https://luarocks.org/dev luaformatter
```

**Yaml, Json, Javascript, HTML, CSS**

``` bash
npm install -g prettier
```

**Markdown**

``` bash
pandoc
```

## Vim Gists

To use vim-gists you will need to configure the following:

``` bash
git config --global github.user <username>
```

## Snippets

If you are looking for snippets checkout this github topic: [Snippet
Topic](https://github.com/topics/vscode-snippets)

## De-bugging

To set up your particular debugger, look here:
[link](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap/wiki/Debug-Adapter-installation)

## TODO

**HIGH PRIORITY**

Move user config into `config.lua` ts-comment string for react
From here I will update for bug fixes and implement low priority
features when I have time
highlight EndOfBuffer ctermfg=black ctermbg=black set to background color for lunar to Hide `~`s in 


**LOW PRIORITY**

- vim vsnips dir should be co-located with config
- list all binaries needed for formatters and linters (one day add in wiki)
- Implement what I can from this java config:
  [link](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-jdtls/wiki/Sample-Configurations)
  - better ui for code actions - formatting
  - setup junit tests for java
- look into emmet-ls
- vim ult test
- which-key all in lua
- what is `fzy`
- https://github.com/pwntester/octo.nvim
- configure surround
- Implement this for typescript https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/nvim-lsp-ts-utils
- look into tabnine


**PLUGIN BUGS**

REACT COMMENTING IS A NIGHTMARE (the filetype is just not recognized idk why)
